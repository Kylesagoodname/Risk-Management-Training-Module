	<h1 id="description-landing">Physical Safety</h1>
	<p>Maintaining the physical safety of King County citizens and its employees should be the most important priority in a risk management exercise.</p>

	<p>Protecting physical security can involve many factors, such as emergency procedures for the facilities, the amount of security around the buildings and the amount of protection possessed by officers during their day to day activities. Finding the most vulnerable areas of King County PD's security and providing controls that can help protect them is an ongoing job that must be carried out.</p>

	<h3>Fire</h3>
	<p>Fire is a major risk for any type of organization because of the devastating impact that it can have. Fire can potentially destroy all of the assets present in a King County PD building. While fire is less likely to occur than other threats, the impact of a fire is enough to make it a risk worth taking into account.

	<h3>Dangerous Individuals</h3>
	<p>Due to the fact that King County Police Department often deals with criminals and people suspected of crimes, there has to be some kind of physical security in place for employees. If there is not any layer of physical security, employees could be attacked or severely harmed.</p>

	<h3>Adhere to Fire Department Protocols</h3>
	<p>For buildings within the King County Police Department, it is important to follow fire guidelines and have multiple exits in case of fire. Making sure that the exits are clear at all times can also help protect human lives.</p>

	<p>In addition to having multiple fire exits, also make sure that smoke alarms are present and have their battery changed often. In emergencies, it is also recommended to have multiple fire extinguishers onsite.</p>

	<h3>Gated Perimeters</h3>
	<p>To prevent dangerous individuals from finding their way into a building run by King County PD, make sure that there is some kind of gated perimeter that people will have to pass through to reach the inner rooms of the building.</p>

	<p>On this gated perimeter you can have authentication checks and security guards to facilitate people coming and leaving the building.</p>

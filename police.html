	<h1 id="threat-landing">Threats</h1>
	<h3>Phishing</h3>
	<p>Phishing is a method through which an attacker can obtain private information about the victim. The attacker generally will send fraudulent email messages or text messages in an attempt to get the victim to navigate to a link and submitting private information. </p>
	<p>In the broader context of sheriffs within King County Police Department, phishing is an an attack that could compromise the private information of a victim and give the attacker permissions granted to sheriffs. It is important to protect against this type of attack because the information that sheriffs have access to has a lot of value to the police department.<p>
	<h3>Spoofing</h3>
	<p>A spoofing attack is when someone pretends to be someone else in order to obtain certain information or gain access to information that they are unauthorized to view.</p>
	<p>Spoofing is a significant risk with police officers, because much of their authentication information relies on the equipment that they carry and the uniform that they wear. If a malicious individual were to get a hold of an officer's uniform, they could trick other people into thinking that they are a valid police officer. </p>

	<h3>Guard Against Spam</h3>

	<p>For officers that use email to communicate with other employees within King County Police Department, having an appropriate spam filter for your email client is essential. A spam filter will help block emails from illegitimate vendors and prevent fraudulent emails from finding their way into your inbox. Many common email clients (ex. Gmail, Yahoo) will do this for you automatically, but keeping an eye out for senders with names that are hidden or modified.</p>


	<h3>Multifactor Authentication</h3>
	<p>The process of verifying an officer's identy should not contain one check only. Multiple methods of authentication should be required to verify an officer's identity. An officer should always carry a badge for authentication, as well as have a personal id number of some kind to verify their identity to internal staff. </p>

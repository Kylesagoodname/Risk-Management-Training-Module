	<h1 id="description-landing">Electricity</h1>
	<p>Electricity is a vital asset to the King County Police Department because it allows facilities to be lit and maintained, as well as provides power for the computers and networking gear that serve the department. Everything from computer aided dispatch to the telephones utilize electricity.</p>

	<p>Ensuring that the electricity in the police department is up and running at all times is important for it to function. Without electricity none of the internal police department would be able to function and serve its purpose.</p>

	<h3>Natural Disasters</h3>
	<p>Major natural disasters are rare to come by for the King County Police Department, but have the potential to do major damage to its facilities. When these disasters happen, the electricity that services King County Police Department can be knocked out for some time. It is important that electricity be restored quickly so that the police department can continue to service its community with as little downtime as possible.

	<h3>Backup Generators</h3>
	<p>Having a backup generator helps reduce the impact of natural disasters by providing emergency electricity to buildings when the main power source runs out. Generators have a limited supply of energy that they can output, but provide an alternative power source until the main power source can be fixed and restored.</p>

	<h1 id="description-landing">Dispatchers</h1>
	<p>When a citizen has an emergency anywhere in King County, the call is routed to the appropriate 9-1-1 center. If the system is not programmed for the correct center, the call is routed to the King County Communications Center where we determine which agency has jurisdiction and forward the call to them. 

The King County Sheriff's Office handles calls from unincorporated King County, twelve cities, Metro Transit Police, King County Airport Police, and King County Animal Control. Over half a million people rely on our call receivers, dispatchers, and other personnel. Our staff answer and dispatch calls for police services, take police reports by phone, research “tape” requests, support the computer aided dispatch (CAD) and E-911 systems, and manage a host of special projects and functions. <br> <br>

All calls are received and processed by an electronic call router and delivered to waiting call taking operators based on whether 9-1-1 or a non-emergency number was dialed. The call is answered and screened for emergency response criteria by a primary (emergency) operator. If a deputy will be dispatched, the operator enters the information into a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system and it is electronically routed to the proper dispatcher based on the location of the call. If the call can be handled without dispatching a deputy, or if an incident report will be taken in the Communications Center, the caller is routed to a secondary (non-emergency) operator to acquire the necessary information and prepare the report. Dispatchers process the information received in CAD, as well as information received from deputies talking to them on the radio. Dispatchers may have as many as 50 units on one radio channel, coordinating work between Sheriffs Office deputies and detectives as well as providing radio contact for contract cities, King County Animal Control and Metro Transit Police.

	<h3>Social Engineering</h3>
	<p>Social Engineering is a non-technical method of obtaining confidential information. The most common social engineering attacks will manipulate people into giving up private information through emails or verbal communication. Social engineering is a component of many, if not most, types of exploits. Virus writers use social engineering tactics to persuade people to run malware-laden email attachments, phishers use social engineering to convince people to divulge sensitive information, and scareware vendors use social engineering to frighten people into running software that is useless at best and dangerous at worst.</p>
	<p>In King County Police Department, dispatchers can be subject to social engineering through communications via telphone. Since dispatchers are constantly communicating with people calling in emergencies, they put themselves at risk to give up too much information.</p>

	<h3>Authentication</h3>

	<p>For people who are contacting the Police Department over the phone, make sure to ask for contact information (such as name, location) as well as record the phone number of the person calling. Asking them to verify themselves will help document important information about the person, should they try to socially engineer information through verbal communication. </p>


	<h3>Proper Training</h3>
	<p>A common way to prevent social engineering attacks is to have proper training in your job role. Knowing what information you are allowed to disclose, as well as what information you must withhold, is an essential part of being a dispatcher. For dispatch calls you are generally gathering information from people who call in emergencies, but keep an eye out for people who discreetly try to gain information about other employees and or emergencies.</p>

	<p>People calling in emergencies should not be requesting information about specific employees, nor should they be engaging in personal talks with the dispatcher. Understanding when this type of situation arises is key to preventing social engineering attacks.</p>
